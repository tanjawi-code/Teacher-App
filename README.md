# Teacher app project

- introduction.

A simple java project to manage and store students' details.

## project description :

This project allows you to :

- manage students' details (add student, remove student, edit, ect).
- Allows you to see statistics (number of students, number of passed students, number of failed students, highest
point, lowest point, class average, success rate, and the top three students in the class).
- Provide a simple screen of dealing with the program.
---
## To-Do list.
- [  ] Add login screen.
- [  ] Add GUI swing to the project.
- [  ] Add gender (male or female).
- [  ] Make things more clear and simple.
- [  ] Add searching ways : (age, point, grade, passed or failed, and male or female).
---
## Problems need to be fixed.
- Find a solution to reduce using try-catch without methods too much.
- Make the program hold all the problems of (InputMismatchException) to avoid stopping the program while working.
- Fix the problem in the method (modifyStudent). The problem is when you search for a student by a name, and the name
is not in the list of the students. The program continues and let you modify the details of the first student instead of
showing you that the incorrect name is not in the list. 
---
## Future improvements.
- Add database support (MySQl or SQLite).
- Improve the project by using **JavaFx** instead of swing.
- Add multi-language support (Localization).
