# Teacher app project

- introduction.

A simple java project to manage and store students' details.

## project description :

This project allows you to :

- manage students' details (add student, remove student, edit, ect).
- Allows you to see class statistics and student statistics.
- Provide a GUI screen using Java **Swing**.
- Provide saving file and getting a file, but you only get the file you save in the program.
---
## To-Do list.
- [  ] Add email.
- [  ] Add creating file by user's choice.
---
## Problems need to be fixed.
- Fix the problem in class number, example : when add students like five, and then you want to delete a student, but
  **not the last student because the problem will not happen**. You delete a student, and then you add another 
student. the last student who has 5 as the class number will be the same number of the added student after him.
The last student (5 as class number), the added student (the one after him, 5 as class number). This problem will only
happen when you delete a student and then add a student.
- Fix the problem when clicking on showing the top 3, and then clicking on updating.
---
## Future improvements.
- Add database support (MySQl).
- Improve the project by using **JavaFx** instead of swing.
- Add multi-language support (Localization).
- Add settings to the program.
- Add multi-classes, and multi-levels.
