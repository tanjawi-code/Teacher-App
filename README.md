point, lowest point, class average, success rate, and the top three students in the class).

## To-Do list.
- [  ] Make things more clear and simple.
- [  ] Add searching ways : (age, point, grade, passed or failed, and male or female).
- [  ] Add frames to other buttons in the main frame.
- [  ] Improve Showing statistics for class and for students.
- [  ] Add changing details of the student.

## Problems need to be fixed.
- Find a solution to reduce using try-catch without methods too much.
- Make the program hold all the problems of (InputMismatchException) to avoid stopping the program while working.
- Fix the problem in class number. When the teacher store students in the first step, and then the teacher wants
to add new students that weren't in the list before. The class number starts from 1 instead of continue from the last student in the list.
- Fix the problem in updating button. That shows null if the user press cancel.
---
## Future improvements.
- Add database support (MySQl or SQLite).
- Improve the project by using **JavaFx** instead of swing.
- Add multi-language support (Localization).
