# Teacher app project

- introduction.

A simple java project to manage and store students' details.

## project description :

This project allows you to :

- This is the lastest version 2.7.2 for now.
- You can now add students, modifying grades and age, deleting, saving students in a file, and getting a file.
- You can search for students by these choices: age, point, gender, city, status(passed or failed), and top/low.
- You are able to see class and student statistics in the top.
- You can manage your account by changing your password or deleting your account.
- You might find a problem while using the program that I didn't notice.
- I will stop in this version until I learn **JavaFx**, and then I will change the project from swing to javafx, and add many others things.
---
## Problems need to be fixed.
- Fix the problem in class number, example : when add students like five, and then you want to delete a student, but
  **not the last student because the problem will not happen**. You delete a student, and then you add another 
student. the last student who has 5 as the class number will be the same number of the added student after him.
The last student (5 as class number), the added student (the one after him, 5 as class number). This problem will only
happen when you delete a student and then add a student.
- Fix the problem when clicking on showing the top/low in searching ways, and then clicking on updating.
---
## Future improvements.
- Add database support (MySQl).
- Improve the project by using **JavaFx** instead of swing.
- Add multi-language support (Localization).
- Add settings to the program.
- Add multi-classes, and multi-levels.
- Add email.
- Add multi choices of searching like gender + point + city and many others different ways.
- Let the user enters directly to the program without entering password and name every time a user closes and open it.
